            This webpage shows my love for the food sushi. It has a quick
            intro to what sushi is, talks about some types of sushi, and
            my persoanl connection with sushi.

            I used lighter colors to bring a happy mood, but the colors
            I chose are gentle so reading the text would be comfortable.
            The images I used for the sushi were extra fancy to make it
            look more appealing. I added a goofy personal picture to show
            more about myself and my connection with food.

            The webpage is responsive, specifically, the text sizes will
            get smaller as the screen shrinks, and the images will stack
            vertically when the screen is smaller. Padding was added 
            thoughtfully to make the texts seem less cluttered.

            For accesibility, every image has an alternate text description
            of what the image is. There is a button on the bottom of the 
            page to navigate back to the top of the page.

            This was a fun and quick project to showcase my passion for
            sushi. The biggest challenges for me was definitely formatting
            the sections properly, making sure the margins and padding
            were how I wanted them to be.

                    If I had to choose one food to eat for the rest of my life, it would be sushi. Sushi's
                    directly translate to "it's sour." Sushi fundamentally contains rice and seafood. It often
                    also has seaweed and other ingredients like imitation crab and vegetables.
                    Originally, the main focus of sushi was just the 
                    the rice; specifically rice with vinegar with some fish on top. In present day, sushi has evolved to be so 
                    much more.

                        <li><h3>Nigiri</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            Most people think of this when they hear sushi. It's simply rectangular shaped
                            rice with typically a cut of fish on top. There maybe other types having tamago (sweet egg),
                            crab, or other shellfish on top. A very simple dish that highlights the freshness of the 
                            ingredient.
                        </p>

                        <li><h3>Uramaki</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            These are commonly known as sushi rolls. It is various types of ingredients which
                            can include a selected fish, imitation crab, and vegetables that are wrapped around with
                            seaweed. A key point is that the rice is on the outside. From here, there are rolls that 
                            add more ingredients on top such as more fish, along with different sauce or sauces.
                        </p>

                        <li><h3>Temaki</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            Hand rolls are very appealing to the eye and are a cone shaped form of sushi. While it may have 
                            similar ingredients as the Uramaki, it includes less of them for each hand roll so that the fish
                            inside is emphasized more. Nigiri would be the best form to enjoy purely the fish with rice, but 
                            Temaki includes a little more texture and flavor. Also, it's fun it eat!

                        Food is great. I like a lot of different types of food, but sushi has a special place
                        in my stomach. I've started from the humble California roll and have reached up to Uni Gunkan.
                        With each level up, the prices soar to heights unimaginable. I've only scratched the surface of the 
                        sushi world and hope to explore more of it in the future. With the limits of my wallet, I will 
                        continue to enjoy the paradise of sushi.
